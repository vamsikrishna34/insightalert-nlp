Thanks everyone for joining. Let's begin with the product updates. Jamie will send the latest feature list by Monday. 

We need to finalize the Q2 roadmap by end of next week. Sarah should review the new designs with the UX team. 

Also, Alex must set up a follow-up call with the vendor. Once we have that, we can move ahead with integration.

Team, please prepare your budget proposals before Friday.
